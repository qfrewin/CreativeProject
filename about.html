          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>What follows is a short description of my creative project and how I decided
            what I wanted to do for it.
          </p>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>Over the course of this semester, I hope to create a website that
            can help people with large group scheduling.</p>
          <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            I was working as a front desk assosiate at a gymnastics school during
            the summer of 2020.  Soon after starting my job, I learned that scheduling
            was a nightmare at the facility.  The owners first had to ensure that there
            were enough coaches to teach the classes they wanted to open.  They then
            would have to make sure that class schedules did not interfere with coach
            availability.  Sadly though, that was the easy part.
          </p>
          <p>
            An hour long class
            typcically has four different locations they have to visit at the gym.  In
            total, we had about 20 separate locations for the various classes in the gym.
            At our busiest moments, we could have upwards of 15 classes at a time to
            work into our schedule.  Due to the different natures or levels of the
            classes, we could not overlap or put two groups into one area at the same
            time.  One of our owners would spend hours each night working on a class
            schedule for the next day, a task he found very frustrating because a cascade
            of problems would arise if he messed up even once.  I felt there must be
            a better alternative to the situation, so I started to look for a solution.
          </p>
          <h2>Spreadsheets</h2>
          <p>
            I first started to look for for a program that the owners could buy that
            would do everything for them.  I searched the internet for a while, but
            could not find anything that would meet our criteria or that the owners
            wanted to pay for.  Eventually, I gave up looking for something that already
            existed and instead thought to just make the format of what we had a little
            more readable in the hopes that the head coach could better plan for the
            classes and that the coaches would be less confused on where to go or what
            to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            The schedule we had at the time was just a plain old spreadsheet,
            though I did not have much experience working with them.  I gave it my best
            shot though and created a beautifully formatted schedule using Google Sheets
            (I prefer Google's api over Microsoft 360).  During this process, I learned
            of the power that spreadsheet programs hold.  I was introduced to formulas
            and equations in google sheets, and I thought that maybe instead of looking
            for a company or program that does what we need, that I could maybe make it
            myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of a month or so, I hashed together a new spreadsheet that
            followed the same visual format of the one I created, but that now greatly
            simplified the scheduling process.  After the gym started to implement my
            spreadsheet, I found myself using more and more of my time on its upkeeping.
            The owners would continually enter some value in a field where an equation
            was, or accidentally delete a row and throw off every sheet in the system.
            The spreadsheet took a load off of the owners, but it made my life a lot
            busier.  I wanted the spreadsheet to be able to do more on its own and not
            require me to make daily adjustments in order for it to work.  I was going
            to head to college in a few months and I didn't want to recieve a phone call
            every other day asking me to fix it.  After some more research, I found Google
            Apps Script.
          </p>
          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Google apps script was my first venture into programming.  I had never done
            anything with programming before, and never thought I would.  I really had
            no idea what I was doing, but I found several snippets of code on stack overflow
            or other people's blogs that I would hash together into a sort-a "Frankenstine"
            of a code.  I was eventually able to make my spreadsheet account for processes
            such as adding a new coach or class into the system and reapplying formulas
            when an editor messed them up.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me until just a few days before I
            left for college, but I finally was able to get my spreadsheet to a place
            where I would not have to fix it every day while in school.  Although crude
            and all hard-coded, I was proud of the work I did.  I fell in love with programming
            and decided it was something I wanted to pursue as a career and study it
            in college.
          </p>
          <h2>My Plan</h2>
          <p>
            During my time in school, I learned a lot more about programming.  Although
            I am still proud of the work I did for the gymnastics school, I know I can
            now do better.  I have a lot of ideas of new features to add to it and how
            to just make it more efficient overall.  One of the problems with Google
            sheets is that there are so many ways people can mess with the spreadsheet
            that I just can't account for.  There are also dozens of editting and formatting
            options that I just don't need the user to see or worry about.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hope is
            that during CS 260 to learn enough to implement my program on my own website.
            I would love to have a login page where different users and different gyms
            or businesses could potentially logon and store their own information and
            have options to customize the program to their needs.  Who knows, if I can
            actually make it work, I may consider selling the program.  I know my goal
            is maybe ambitious, but I hope to learn enough this semester to make it happen.
          </p>
